##### <code>Doing everything repetitive that humans don't like. Not only clean-ups / typo corrections. You might know something specific from your field. That is as big as your niche is, if we can fix it for everybody.</code>

### Did you hear about [Wikipedia/MediaWiki Bots?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots) 
 - 2500 such routines are approved there ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Approved_Wikipedia_bot_requests_for_approval )
      - **What about Bots making Pull requests in global Open-Source projects?💡?**
      - **Goal / 'Milestone1':**  
          - **Quality:** Denied pull requests < 10% & average amount of 👍/❤'s per pull request > 0.5? (initially, before people get used to it)   
          - **Quantity:**  > 1 million automatic pull requests // worth >100.000 working hours: Hypothesis: **Probably easy 😱** spending only < 3000 hours here. Or < 3% (_Efficiency could raise donations against hunger etc. Old News: There is Abundance. And opportunity, only society, that can be bitter... 🤔  (low server costs. A task worth >$5 often only costs <$0.001 in electricitiy.)_
  
# To-Do
- much of what Wikipedia Bots do, simple typos, grammar, formating. 
- specific errors of readme.md's 
- syntax debugging in all file types, formalities and code languages. 
  - **Specific Category Example:** ( from our experience ) the following tiny, rare task alone might have been done a million times in history (by 1000s of people)
    - **Browser-Extensions**: Syncing lines from their english languages files (en/messages.json) to all their other existing languages files. (_specifically  https://((GitHub|BitBucket).com|SoureForge.net|gitlab.io)/\w*/$BrowserExtensionName/_locales/[a-z][a-z][a-zA-Z_]?[A-Z]?[A-Z]?/**messages.json**_ )   ( google wont show all: [inurl:messages.json  site:github.com OR site:bitbucket.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Amessages.json++site%3Agithub.com+OR+site%3Abitbucket.com) )
      - this task wont mean a lot every time. However developers will feel good to see it & start to expect more pull requests.
      - it is likely that all pull requests will be merged (accepted).
      - Explanation: if there is a new item in en.json, then it should always be copied already to all other language files, because if it is not, then the extension will not fall back to the default language: English (as stated in the manifest.json), but it will instead show the internal names from code.
        - imaginable contraindications: <br>_(probably not required to bring denied pull requests to zero/minimum or 1%° (1 in 1000)_ 
           - Same names(labels) in Code & English.
           - International labels in Code (emojis / simplified english / ???)
   - Of course the Example above exists only **based on an complicated part of** (Browser-Extension-)**formality.  However it will be faster/easier to build this than the world** (/web browsers) improving such a standard ( / worth it still even if they'd start today)
