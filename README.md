> ##### <code><code>_Robotic Pull Requests - Getting done everything repetitive that humans don't like. Not only debugging or typo clean-ups. You might know something specific from your field, that is as big as your field is, if we can fix it for everybody._</code></code>

## Did you hear about [Wikipedia-&MediaWiki-Bots?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots) 
 - 2500 such routines are approved there:  [en.wikipedia.org/Category:Approved_Wikipedia_bot_requests_for_approval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Approved_Wikipedia_bot_requests_for_approval) <br> ( + _compare: [**huginn**](https://github.com/huginn/huginn); ([siteinspector](https://github.com/siteinspector/siteinspector), [actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow), [stackstorm](https://exchange.stackstorm.org), [github action for code typos](https://github.com/marketplace/typo-ci),..._ )  

(<i> Compare: Just a tool to search for API keys / private keys etc in a repo [Git Hound](https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/tree/master/internal/app) - was awarded $7500 'bug bounty' by GitHub - so assumably this will result in Github notifications already? - vs. [wild-hunt](https://github.com/d1vious/git-wild-hunt#what-checks-get-run-regexesjson)  </i> )

  - **wwwhat about Bots also making Pull requests in global Open-Source projects?ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡**

      -  Vision "Milestone 1" : a 1+ million automatic pull requests, worth 100 000+ working hours.
         -  Reaching this goal could be as efficient as (ðŸ˜±)spending only < 3000 hours here. Or < 3% of the working hours to save
             - _that could motivate the beneficiaries to donations to us or against hunger etc... (Old News: There is Abundance of opportunity. (Only society, that can be bitter... ðŸ¤”) (Efficient computers too)_
         -  Minimum quality to surpass (at least if without asking, and people who dont know it): Denied pull requests < 10%?  
            - (So this project repo would collect ['awesome Patterns'](https://github.com/code4charity/PATTERNs--The-RegEx-Collector-queries-ontologies-sql-sparql-nosql-structured-unstructured-data))

## 1. Some things To-Do
- anything that enhances & fits in line with existing  [.github/workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) routines  
- much of what Wikipedia Bots do everywhere: 
    - simple(non-debatable)  typos, grammar, formating.   
    - Periodic updates of static data (that is intentionally(or practically) marked up though and just waiting). 
- specific errors of readme.md's or other specific files and/or formats. 
- syntax debugging in all file-types, formalities and code languages. 
(- Loss-less compression of machine files.)

#### 3. Some specific Category Examples: 
  - **Browser-Extension Manifest v3**:  We can automate some of the work (, <i> that becomes inevitable to all extension by ~2023~ 2024(?)<i>,) (Through some regex etc.) https://github.com/code4charity/Manifest-v3     
    - An (almost rare) task alone might still has been done a million times in history (by 1000s of people), **for example:** <br>        **Browser-Extension translation**:   Syncing lines from their English language file (_en/messages.json_) to all their other existing languages files, **if** they are simple and can be auto-translated well enough properly. (_specifically  https://((GitHub|BitBucket).com|SoureForge.net|gitlab.io)/\w*/$BrowserExtensionName/_locales/[a-z][a-z][a-zA-Z_]?[A-Z]?[A-Z]?/**messages.json**_ )   ( google wont show all: [inurl:messages.json  site:github.com OR site:bitbucket.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Amessages.json++site%3Agithub.com+OR+site%3Abitbucket.com) )
      - this task wont mean a lot every time. However developers might enjoy to see it. So it is likely that most pull requests for this will be merged(=accepted).
        - imaginable contraindications to look for: <br>_(even not required to bring denied pull requests to zero)_ 
           - International labels in Code (emojis / simplified english / ???)    (makes the edit bad)
  - **Please add any examples:**
    - **Example 1:**
       - ...
         - ...
    - **Example 2:**
       - ...
    - **Example 3:** 
       - ...
