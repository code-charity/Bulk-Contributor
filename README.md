_Doing everything repetitive that humans don't like. Not only clean-ups / typo corrections. You might know something specific from your niche. That is as big as your niche is, if we can fix it for everybody._

- Did you hear about Wikipedia / MediaWiki Bots? ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots ) 
  - 2500 such routines are approved there ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Approved_Wikipedia_bot_requests_for_approval )
     - **What about Bots making Pull requests in global Open-Source projects**
     - Goal / 'Milestone1':   
           - Quantity:  > 1 million automatic pull requests // worth >100.000 working hours: **Probably easy 😱** with at least 30 times fewer hours*
           - Quality: Denied pull requests < 10% and average amount of 👍❤'s per pull request > 0.5? (initially people get used to it)    

* _And low server costs. A task worth >$5 often only costs <$0.001 in electricitiy. So donations could be raised for hungry people. Old News: There is Abundance. And opportunity, only society, thats is bitter..._ 🤔 

# To-Do
- much of what Wikipedia Bots do, simple typos, grammar, format.
- specific format errors of readme.md's

- syntax debugging in all file types / code languages. 
- **Specific Category Example...** ( _"Everybody might know something from their niche..."_ ) <br> ...the following tiny, rare task alone might have been done a million times in history (by 1000s of people)
  - Syncing lines from all Browser-Extensions, from their english languages files (en/messages.json), to all their other existing languages files.  (_specifically  ((GitHub|BitBucket).com|SoureForge.net|gitlab.io)/\w*/$BrowserExtensionName/_locales/[a-z][a-z][a-zA-Z_]?[A-Z]?[A-Z]?/**messages.json**_ )
  - this task wont mean a lot every time. However developers will feel good to see it & start to expect more pull requests.
  - it is unlikely than any pull-requests will be denied.
  - Explanation: if there is a new item in en.json, then it should always be copied to all other language files, because if it is not, then the extension will not fall back to the default language: English (as stated in the manifest.json), but it will instead show the internal names from code.
  - imaginable contraindications:   _(probably not required to bring denied pull requests to zero/minimum/1%° (1 in 1000)_ 
  - Same names in Code & English.
  - International names in Code (emojis / simplified english)
  - Of course the Example above exists only based on the annoying part of Browser-Extension formality:  However it will be faster to build this than changing all web browsers...And worth it still even if they start changing today.
